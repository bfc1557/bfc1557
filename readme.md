### Hello friend Githuber, 👋
Welcome to my tiny spot on github. This is my workspace where I share codes, interact with others programmers and solve problems.

### About Me
I'm a 17yo programmer that is studying at [ESEN](https://www.esenviseu.net/). 
I am fast thinker, persistent and creative. Like every human I have weakness, that is, I dont like to work in group. But I try to do when it is needed.
I chosed programming because:
 -Is a modern and dinamic thing that is always changing it self and the world;
 -Every code is a challenge for me, even the little ones, because I always look for efficiency and compactness
 -I love to think and solve problems;
 -Always motivated even if it seems impossible;
 -I love coffee and innovate.
