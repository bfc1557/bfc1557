### ðŸ‘‹ Hello Githuber friend,
Welcome to my tiny spot on github. This is my workspace where I share codes, interact with others programmers and solve problems.

### About Me
I'm a 17yo programmer that is studying at [ESEN](https://www.esenviseu.net/). 
I am fast thinker, persistent and creative. Like every human I have weakness, one of them is, I dont like to work in group. But I try to do when is needed.
I love Anime, Games, Pets, Milk and coffee.

I chosed programming because:
- Is a modern and dinamic thing that is always changing it self and the world;
- Every code is a challenge for me, even the little ones, because I always look for efficiency and compactness;
- I love to think and solve problems;
- Always motivated even if it seems impossible;
- I love coffee and innovate.
